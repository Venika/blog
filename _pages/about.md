Hello! My name is Venika Gaur and I am a Platform Engineer. I graduated with my Bachelors degree in Computer Science in 2020. I'm passionate about programming and love to constantly learn new skills and programming languages. My go-to languages are Python, Java and the MERN tech stack. In addition to my technical skills, I'm committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in tech. As a coach with CodePath, a nonprofit that helps underrepresented students break into the industry, and as a judge at Major League Hacking hackathons, I'm able to put this passion into action. Helping out and mentoring others is something that brings me joy and fulfillment. Fun fact about me: I can solve a Rubik's cube in under a minute!

<!-- This blog is for me to share things that I have learned,  -->
